    fields:
    - name: Getting from subreddits
      value: |
        Putting the subreddit name will get random posts from there. For example: `l.reddit r/aww`

        You can sort by:
        - `hot`
        - `new`
        - `rising`
        - `top`, where you can also specify if you want top of: `hour`, `day`, `week`, `month`, `year`, or `all`.
        - `controversial`

        For example: `l.reddit r/aww rising` or `l.reddit r/aww top year`

        After sorting, a number can be added at the end to specify how many posts you want to fetch. For example: `l.reddit r/aww hot 5`
    - name: Getting from users
      value: |
        With users, you can get their profile information or their posts. For example `l.reddit u/camto about` will get that user's information, and `l.reddit u/camto posts` will get their newest posts.

        If getting posts, sorting and specifying the number of posts can be done the same way as it's done for subreddits. For example, `l.reddit u/camto posts top all 5` will get that user's top 5 posts they ever made.
  msg: Sends a link to a random reddit post.
